   > No matching variant of com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.1 was found. The consumer was configured to find a runtime of a library compatible with Java 8, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally, as well as attribute 'org.gradle.plugin.api-version' with value '7.6.3' but:
       - Variant 'apiElements' capability com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.1 declares a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
           - Incompatible because this component declares an API of a component compatible with Java 11 and the consumer needed a runtime of a component compatible with Java 8
           - Other compatible attribute:
               - Doesn't say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required '7.6.3')
       - Variant 'javadocElements' capability com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.1 declares a runtime of a component, and its dependencies declared externally:
           - Incompatible because this component declares documentation and the consumer needed a library
           - Other compatible attributes:
               - Doesn't say anything about its target Java version (required compatibility with Java 8)
               - Doesn't say anything about its elements (required them packaged as a jar)
               - Doesn't say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required '7.6.3')
       - Variant 'runtimeElements' capability com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.1 declares a runtime of a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
